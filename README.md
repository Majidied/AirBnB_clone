### Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a software engineering endeavor aimed at recreating a simplified version of the beloved accommodation rental platform, Airbnb. Our mission is to design and implement various components of the application, including frontend user interfaces, backend servers, and database management systems. The project strives to replicate key functionalities of Airbnb, such as user authentication, property listing, booking management, and search functionality.
